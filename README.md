## 🧠 Personal Note

This project was built as part of the **Angular course** at the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**, a prestigious tech institute under Egypt's Ministry of Communications. While it was a team effort, I didn't contribute heavily to the frontend development — my main focus remains on backend development (Laravel, Node.js, and backend systems in general). I still wanted to share it as part of my learning journey and collaborative experience.
